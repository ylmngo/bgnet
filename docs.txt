File Descriptors:  
When any Unix programs do any sort of IO, they do so through the use of file descriptors
File descriptors are integers that are present for any open file. 
This file can be anything, network connection, FIFO, a pipe , a terminal. 
In C/C++, File Descriptors are implemented through the use of FILE pointers 

Sockets: 
Sockets are reliable two-way connection between streams. 
There are many types of Sockets: Internet Sockets, Unix Sockets, X.25 Sockets 
There are mainly two types of Internet Sockets: Stream Sockets(SOCK_STREAM), Datagram Sockets(SOCK_DGRAM). 
Datagram Sockets are also called connectionless sockets. 
HTTP Protocol uses Stream Sockets to get pages. 
Stream Sockets use TCP Protocol 
Datagram Sockets use UDP Protocol

Data Communication Protocols 
TCP and UDP for Data Transmission, IP for Intenret Routing 
UDP does not require a connection, as such it is used in tasks which do not require precise Data 
Eg: Multiplayer games, streaming, audio, video conferencing. 
UDP is way faster than TCP at the cost of reliability 
The TCP/IP Stack: 
    Application Layer (telnet/ftp) 
    Transport Layer   (TCP, UDP) 
    Internet Layer    (IP and routing) 
    Physical Layer    (Ethernet, Wifi)

Structs 
struct addrinfo {
    int      ai_flags; //AI_PASSIVE, AI_CANNONNAME 
    int      ai_family; //AF_INET (integer value of 2), AF_INET6 (integer value of 10)
    int      ai_socktype; //SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM 
    int      ai_protocol; //use 0 for any 
    size_t   ai_addrlen; // size of ai_addr in bytes 
    sockaddr *ai_addr; //struct sockaddr_in 
    char     *ai_cannonname; //full canonical hostname 

    addrinfo *ai_next; //pointer to next node 
}; 

getaddrinfo() returns a pointer to the first node of a linked list of above structures 

struct sockaddr {
    unsigned short sa_family; //address family 
    char           sa_data[14]; //14 bytes of protocol address  
};

struct sockaddr_in {
    short int          sin_family; //Address Family 
    unsigned short int sin_port; //Port Number 
    in_addr            sin_addr; //Internet Address 
    unsigned char      sin_zero[8]; //Same size as struct sockaddr   
};

sockaddr_in can be cast to sockadrr
sin_zero is added to pad the length of the struct to be the same as sock_addr 

struct in_addr {
    uint32_t s_addr; // 32 bit integer 
}; 

s_addr references the 4 Byte IP Address 

Chapter -5 

int getaddrinfo(const char* node
                const char* service, 
                const struct addrinfo *hints,
                struct addrinfo **res) 
        
parameters: 
node - hostname or an IP address to which we have to connect 
service - port number or a particular service like http or ftp 
hints - pointer to a struct addrinfo that we have already filled out.
res - pointer to a linked in which our result gets stored in 

getaddrinfo returns an integer value indicating the success or failure. 
it preps the socket address structure (sockaddr_in or ai_addr in addrinfo)   

const char* inet_ntop(int af, const void *src, char *dst, socklen_t size); 

parameters: 
af - address family (AF_INET or AF_INET6) 
src - socket address family 
dst - resultant string in which the IP address is stored 
size - size of IP string 

inet_ntop converts the IP address in bytes (network byte order) to character string 

int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol); 

parameters: 
domain - IPv4 or IPv6 (here, PF_INET or PF_INET6) PF - protocol family 
type - socket type (SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM) 
protocol - (TCP or UDP), can be set to 0 

socket() returns a socket descriptor that can be used later in system calls
